description: "Trilby is a novel by George du Maurier and one of the most popular novels\
  \ of its time. Published serially in Harper's Monthly in 1894, it was published\
  \ in book form in 1895 and sold 200,000 copies in the United States alone. Trilby\
  \ is set in the 1850s in an idyllic bohemian Paris. Though it features the stories\
  \ of two English artists and a Scottish artist, one of the most memorable characters\
  \ is Svengali, a rogue, masterful musician and hypnotist.\nTrilby O'Ferrall, the\
  \ novel's heroine, is a half-Irish girl working in Paris as an artists' model and\
  \ laundress; all the men in the novel are in love with her. The relationship between\
  \ Trilby and Svengali forms only a small, though crucial, portion of the novel,\
  \ which is mainly an evocation of a milieu.\nLuc Sante wrote that the novel had\
  \ a \"decisive influence on the stereotypical notion of bohemia\" and that it \"\
  affected the habits of American youth, particularly young women, who derived from\
  \ it the courage to call themselves artists and 'bachelor girls,' to smoke cigarettes\
  \ and drink Chianti.\"\nThe novel has been adapted to the stage several times; one\
  \ of these featured the lead actress wearing a distinctive short-brimmed hat with\
  \ a sharp snap to the back of the brim. The hat became known as the trilby and went\
  \ on to become a popular men's clothing item in the United Kingdom throughout various\
  \ parts of the 20th century, before enjoying a revival as a unisex clothing item\
  \ in the United States in the 2000s.\nThe novel has been highly criticised for antisemitism\
  \ in its portrayal of the character Svengali.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
